SciamLab has presented **Amaca Content Discovery and Enrichment Platform** during **the Apache Hadoop Summit Europe** in Amsterdam. 
Hadoop Summit is **the leading conference** dedicated to the advancement of **Apache Hadoop**.

Amaca is one of our top products. It is a **search engine and data enrichment** that uses Apache Hadoop distribution to process and to keep the update cycle of the catalog within the limits of a few hours.

This **innovative platform** employs algorithms for text analysis and learning techniques to produce and enrich in an automatic way the metadata that describes the data set, making it easier and more effective their search and access.

At the conference **SciamLab** showed how Amaca also provides part of **the extraction of metadata** from sources on the web of the Public Administrations and private companies that have advertised the release of open data where possible through the API or extracting information directly from the HTML.

Another new feature presented was **the easily interoperability**. The internal model of the dataset is now easily interoperable with any platform and allows Amaca to pour and publish information in the main catalogs as CKAN, Socrata, DataPublic, etc.

In Amsterdam Amaca has attracted **the interest of many attendees** and companies. With companies interested in the product SciamLab has had several face to face sessions and has performed a live product demo.
