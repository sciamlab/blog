During the International Open Data Day 2013 in Rome **SciamLab** has presented **the OpenDataHub Italia**.

Opendatahub.it is currently the most important and widely used platform **for indexing and searching open datasets** (Open Data) available in Italy.

The index and the information about the dataset are drawn up by a search engine and data enrichment called **Amaca**, implemented by **SciamLab**.

Amaca uses **Apache Hadoop** for the process and to keep the update cycle of the catalog within the limits of a few hours.

The elaboration is done through **MapReduce**. The algorithms are employed for the analysis of texts in Italian and learning techniques to produce and enrich automatically metadata that describes the dataset, making it easier and more effective their research and access.

Amaca also provides the extraction of metadata from sources on the web of the Public Administrations and private companies that have advertised the release of open data were possible through the **API** or extracting information directly from the **HTML**.
