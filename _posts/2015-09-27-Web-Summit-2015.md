We are pleased to annunce that we have been selected to partecipate at the next **Web Summit** that will take place in Dublin (Ireland) the 3-5 of November. It is **the most important tech event in Europe** with more than 30.000 attendees.  

We think It is a great opportunity for **startups from around the world** to meet, exchange ideas and get in touch with investors and entrepreneurs.

On stage will speak several **big names** in the world technology like Ed Catmull, president of Pixar Animation Studios; Mike Krieger, co-funder of Instagram; Deb Roy, chief Media Scientist for Twitter; or Scott Chacon, co-funder of GitHub. And much more! There will be more than 1.000 speakers!  

This three days will be very exciting for us to discover the latest in tech and do network with collegues form around the world. 

This will be the last year that the Web Summit will be done in Dublin. In 2016 it is to be located in Lisbon. 

Stay tuned! We will let you know more soon!
