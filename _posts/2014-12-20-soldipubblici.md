“By understanding how governments spend money in our name can we have a say in how that money will affect our own lives.”[source](https://openspending.org/)

To be more transparent on how public administrations spend in Italy, **SciamLab** was the main contributor in the realization of [the Italian Government Site SoldiPubblici](http://soldipubblici.gov.it), the communication of government spending to citizens.

The site is **a semantic search engine** built on Apache Solr. It integrates the data from **SIOPE** (Sistema Informativo delle Operazioni degli Enti Pubblici), the information system for the public government operations, with a semantic dictionary that enables users to search public administration expenditures using common words, other then compare them to other ones.

This first release allows you to access the data of monthly payments to the regions, to the provinces, to the municipalities and to regional health agencies. 
The next stages of the project will cover the possibility to directly download data and will be produced an extension of the search, visualization and data analysis based on other public administration categories. That will be an opportunity to broaden the spectrum to all public administrations.

On the other hand, perhaps the most important challenge regards **electronic invoicing**. From 31 March 2015, all suppliers of local public administrations will have to compulsorily send electronic invoices, as already do the suppliers of central public administrations from June 6 this year.

**SciamLab** has worked in this project with a view to greater transparency and participation. Our objectives have been to promote and improve access to the citizens of the public administration expenditure.
