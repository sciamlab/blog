SciamLab is growing and expanding its business in Italy and even most importantly outside the Italian frontiers!

To increase our visibility and to make easier for more people to access [SciamLab](http://www.sciamlab.com/) and [OpenDataHub](http://www.sciamlab.com/opendatahub/) site we decided to make a big step ahead for the SciamLab portal!

Our website was born in English, the language we work daily and the most international one.
SciamLab announce today the new internationalized version of the site with two new languages available: **Italian and Spanish**!! 

This not only means that we have a website in three different languages, it also means that you can communicate with us **in any of these languages**.

We have decided to incorporate the Italian because it is the language of the country where we headquarter and where we mostly develop our business, and Spanish because it is the markets with which we currently work and plan to expand in the next future. Stay tuned for great news coming up in the next weeks!

This does not mean we do not want to work in other languages, we are open to work with all places in the world and their respective languages. Soon you will know more!

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please [contact us](http://www.sciamlab.com/company/contact_us.shtml.en). We will be happy to answer!
