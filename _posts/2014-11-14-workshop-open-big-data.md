The visualization of data and information is the new frontier for communications design and artistic and creative activities. **SciamLab** has organized and held **an innovative data analysis and visualization workshop** with the Rome University of Fine Arts (RUFA) and [Millepiani](http://www.millepiani.eu). 

At the workshop **artists and visual designers** have faced together the issue of open data and big data and how to make them available through their display.

**From infographics to digital applications** that enable users explore the information flows. And for example, a creative design as representation of the invisible, not as "opaque" but as "Abstract".

"The aesthetics of flows: Open date and Big Data Visualization" has transferred the skills of the work in multidisciplinary team applied to **the analysis and visualization of data**. 

This innovative workshop was addressed to RUFA students of the second and third year and organized by Enrico Parisio and Alessio Dragoni. 

The future will be for minds that are smart creative, business expertise and technical skill. So let's start working together!
