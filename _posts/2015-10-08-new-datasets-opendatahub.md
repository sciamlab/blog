**Indexed more than 18k italian dataset in the OpenDataHUB!**



SciamLab is pleased to announce that we have set another record indexing and keeping regularly updated **more than 18000 open data sets** from **over 200 organizations** in our Italian Open Data HUB!

This is a further confirmation that the Amaca content discovery platform is scaling well providing a fast and fully automated mechanism that cope with the exponential growth in number and complexity of the datasets published by the Italian public administrations and private organizations. The discovery feature has been recently extended to the geographic information available in the many geoportals across Italy. Thanks to this new feature you can now perform searches in a unique place against most of the available open data like it's happening already in other countries like UK, Germany and many others.

Just during the last week we have added **more than 5.000 datasets.**

This is a great news also for Italy since from a more accurate analysis of the available datasets, that was not possible before, we discovered that most of the reports and indicators that place Italy between the worst performers, using the Amaca Discovery Platform become quickly obsolete.  However the needs to open high quality datasets set by the G8 Open Data Charter remain far to be fully matched, and key datasets and categories **like company and business registry** or **education and schools performances** and others are still missing.

Based on [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/asset_release/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe-final#download-links) standard and the more recent [GeoDCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/139283), Amaca during the harvesting process is providing harmonization of the collected metadata, unsupervised classification using the new theme categories, metadata inter-linking with DBPedia and other Italian repositories and finally further metadata enrichment to estimate the dataset popularity and value from different indicators.

You now can search over **18.000 Italian datasets**! Do not lose the chance to discover them [here!](http://www.sciamlab.com/opendatahub/)
If you are a developers you can also access the entire metadata catalog and reuse for free it under a CC-BY license using the  

SciamLab will continue working to grow and improve Amaca and the bottom API that make this possible.
