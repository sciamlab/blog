It is not always easy to find public **open data**. For this we want to talk about one of the most interesting and important projects that currently exists, the GDELT Project.

It is the largest real time **database of human society** ever created. The aim is to better understand global human society and especially the connection between communicative discourse and physical societal-scale behaviour. 

To do it the platform monitors **the world's news media** from nearly every country in print, broadcast, and web formats, in over 100 languages.

The vision of the GDELT Project is to codify the entire planet into a computable format using all available open information sources that provides a new platform for understanding the global world.

GDELT allows you to create interactive maps or timelines exploring and contrasting events, topics and languages.  

The entire GDELT database is **100% free and opened to be downloaded** as raw text data files to be used in your own projects.

For instance, GDELT has been used by medias to explore **protest trends in Egypt since the Arab Spring**. Particularly an article on The Cairo Review's highlights the special role of "big data" in understanding protest trends.

GDELT has also been used by medias to explore the state of **television coverage** of the candidates for US elections. For example, The Daily Mail and the Los Angeles Times used GDELT's 2016 Candidate Television Tracker to comment on the state of television coverage of the candidates and how Trump has so successfully wielded earned media coverage compared with his competitor's.
