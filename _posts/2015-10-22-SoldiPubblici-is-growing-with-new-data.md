Almost a year ago, we were the main contributor to the realization of the Italian Government Site [SoldiPubblici](http://soldipubblici.gov.it/it/home), the portal exposing government spendings to citizens. 

SoldiPubblici is doing now one step further, adding payments made with electronic mandates by the Central Government institutions such as **Ministries, Metropolitan Cities or University**! (below the full list ← [link](#aabb))

You can now:

**Search** how much money the Italian Ministry of Defense spends on aircrafts. Or how much the Italian Ministry of Health spends on technical specialist materials!

**Download** the SoldiPubblici **Open Data** to make further analysis or build your application at the following [url](http://soldipubblici.gov.it/it/developers). The Data are produced by [SIOPE (Sistema informativo delle operazioni degli enti pubblici)](https://www.siope.it/), a Banca d’Italia system to query income and payments by the Italian Public Administrations.

**Look to the graph** that displays when and how much spending has occurred in recent years in a particular subject.

**Look to the infographic** that displays the summary of payments for an institution and the summary of total payments for institutions of the same type.
