Another great achievement for SciamLab! #italiasicura is live!! Look for the place you live: [#italiasicura](http://mappa.italiasicura.gov.it)

This can be considered one of the most important, and in some way unique, use case in Europe for **open data** reuse in an application that brings **transparency**, **social awareness** and **open government**!

The first European platform for live monitoring on a map of public moneys spent in yards opened by the government to fight hydro-geological instability and emergencies. Zooming in and out it is possible to check fine grained details, until the census area!!

You can check on the map the probability that the area you live can be interested by flood hazard.

SciamLab was present to the presentation of the #italiasicura portal that took place at Palazzo Chigi by members of Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, Ministry of Environment and the National Anti-Corruption Authority.
We are firmly convinced that this kind of initiatives go in the right direction to make citizen properly informed and able to have a direct control about how public money are spent for their own security, bringing more transparency and more eyes over possible administrations corruption and grey zones.
#italiasicura is the result of a team work made by Fondazione Politecnico, Dipartimento della Protezione Civile, ISPRA, Agid.

Data (open) provided by these organizations were cleansed, organized, homogenized and georeferenced, to be represented in a graphical, user friendly portal so that anyone is able to understand his risk exposure.

### Some background

More than six million of Italians live in areas at risk of landslides or flooding. Italy has always been forced to live huge disasters. So, reduce and manage risk is not a cost and investments are the key to restart the country.
Environmental stress and disruption consume a growing share of the state budget. One euro spent on prevention saves up to 100 euro in damage repairs. 

The hydrogeological risk is one of the reasons for the increase of the infrastructure gap in the country. Slip down not only land or houses but also roads and highways, railways, water and electricity. 
The deterioration of the territory constitutes a strongly negative voice in the economic balance of a country, which already has future debt accumulated.

Under the sponsorship of the Presidency of the Council of the Ministries, SciamLab developed mappa.italiasicura.gov.it. It offers the ability to monitor and control public works spending and the progress of construction sites.

It is an interactive map where passing over with the mouse you can see land, population, schools and cultural heritages exposed to hydrogeological risks and at the same time the actions, in terms of public works to decrease these risks. In a distinct map are also detailed the emergencies states till May 2013 region by region.

For example, you can see the total resources committed against insolvency, the resources committed on ongoing interventions or the number of operations in progress.
The site is georeferenced and it is the result of a meticulous analysis of the budgets of the state and all the resources allocated, year after year, to regions and local authorities for works and interventions.
The Government works against landslides and floods and SciamLab works to make the information about it more accessible to everyone.
