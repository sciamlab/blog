We live in the smart era. Technology has changed our everyday lives up to the level which facilitates the management of our waste.

Thinking on this, **SciamLab has created the Smart Waste Management Solution** using a GPRS that enables low cost volume sensors coupled with a Routing Optimization Web Application.

This Smart Waste Management System is used to control the filling level of the containers. **The benefits are enormous**. Routes and pick-up times are optimized and it saves energy and CO2 emissions. Also it avoids having fully loaded containers where garbage is overflowing or, on the contrary, make unnecessary collections where there are half empty containers.

The Smart Waste Management Solution provides to waste management companies and organizations a service that enables **cost savings** between 20% and 40% by monitoring and analyzing the levels of filling of containers in real-time and by optimizing intervals and paths for the waste collection. 

In a system, for an example, where there are 5 containers in 37.5 km you will make 60% fewer collections and 52% less km driven. 

How is it possible? The Smart System could be installed in the roof of all types of containers. The device owner fills level measurement. It is based on an ultrasonic sensor and **the events are sent by wireless RF or GPRS**. It also has a temperature detection integrated and a battery life +10 years. It is weatherproof housing IP67* and the electronic equipment is suitable to withstand extreme conditions (temperature, shock, pressure).
How do we work? We do a real-time monitoring. The signals with filling level and temperature are sent to SciamLab.

**The SciamLab sites** provides the % current and planned,  24h/7d Web interface, real-time status, alerts and tools for planning and management of the fleet of vehicles, dynamic calculation of optimal paths subdivided according to the resources and daily drivers available, supported API for customization and integration with other SmartLab systems. 

The service subscription could be monthly, annual or multi-annual. If you want to know more about it please do not hesitate [to contact us!] (http://beta.sciamlab.com/company/contact_us)
