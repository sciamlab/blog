**SciamLab** with the rest of the team of the **"Il dato è tratto" application** has been awarded for the 3rd place in the ISTAT Censimenti Data Challenge for having submitted **the best app** on the reuse of ISTAT data.

The basic elements of the project are related to the data that the ISTAT produces during censuses and in particular that relating to **the industry census**.

"Il dato è tratto" application aims **to democratize the data** and make it easily usable for anyone. In fact, we are all used with official and unofficial data to be  exposed on the web at the best as tables on which you can apply filters and export data in various format. These data are of difficult comprehension at a first glance and requires further, sometime cumbersome analysis that only some people can do. The goal of the project is to present the data to the next door user in an easy consumable way with the help of graphics. In particular this project uses the elevation of the three dimensional graph as a metric and the region colour as a second metric, making comparison between regions and correlation between metrics easy just looking to the graph.

For these reasons, "Il dato è tratto" started on a trial because it is a project that **tries to combine expertise** in areas completely different as engineering, data analysis or Statistic. But above all it tries to bring this experience in the most artistic, design and communicative way.

Part of this project also aims to build a regional map and to mark on it the ability of the territory itself to react against **unemployment (regional resilience)** through the graphical comparison of the available metrics.
